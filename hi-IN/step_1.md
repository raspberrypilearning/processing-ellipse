Draw a circle or ellipse using: `ellipse(x, y, width, height)`

The ellipse will be drawn using the stroke and fill values that have been set before `ellipse` is called.

language: python

    ellipse(160, 220, 200, 100)  # x, y, width, height

--- /code ---

The ellipse will be centered at the (x, y) coordinates given by the first two numbers.

The third number is the width and the fourth is the height of the ellipse.

Make the width and height the same to draw a circle.
